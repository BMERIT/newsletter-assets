```
├── [year][month] (ex. 202406)
└── global
    ├── Globally used images should be put in this folder
    └── Logo images can be found here
```

Place all assets used in that month by creating the respective folder.

The URL for the assets will be as follows:

`https://bmerit.github.io/newsletter-assets/[folder name]/[image file]`
